#### Aim: Main Focus on the ThreeJS Content

1) Logo and Brand on the top left
2) Menu Bar in the buttom

### Description

For most ThreeJS website, the graphical content is much more important than the menu bar and its Logo.

Therefore put everything on the side and focus on the main windows

### UI Design

This is a top-down approach for ThreeJS Website. It is easy to clone the website, change the tag.

ThreeJS content -> ThreeJS.js
Web Javascript content -> JQuery.js
